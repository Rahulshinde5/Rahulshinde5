### Hi there, I'm Rahul Shinde 👋

A passionate Data Scientist.

- 🔭 I'm currently exploring the world of data and its endless possibilities.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning and expanding my knowledge.
- 📊 I love working on projects that involve data analysis, predictive modeling, and clustering.

### Projects 🚀

🌌 **ML-Based Predictive Modeling for Ketoprofen Adsorbance** - Developed a machine learning model to predict ketoprofen adsorbance using composite materials of magnetic nanoparticles and metal organic frameworks (MMOF). [See it here](https://github.com/Rahulshinde5/ML-Based-Predictive-Modeling-for-Ketoprofen-Adsorbance/blob/main/README.md)

🎥 **Netflix Content Clustering** - Used data science to cluster Netflix movies and TV shows based on genres and release years. [Check it out](https://github.com/Rahulshinde5/Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-Project-/blob/main/README.md)

🏥 **Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction** - Developed a predictive model to identify potential customers for insurance policies. [See it here](https://github.com/Rahulshinde5/Supervised-ML-Classifiacation-Project-/blob/main/README.md)

🚖 **New York City Taxi Trip Time Prediction** - Created a model to predict taxi trip times in NYC using machine learning regression techniques. [Explore the project](https://github.com/Rahulshinde5/Machine-Learning-NYC-Taxi-Trip-Time-Prediction/blob/main/README.md)
